d) Description of Model:

Character-level CNN inspired by Zhang et al. "Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification" (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf). Model uses a simplified architecture (more complex models performed worse) with following layers:

1. Input(char embedding)
2. Conv1D (feature = 1024, kernel = 7, maxPooling = 3, dropout = 0.25)
3. Conv1D (feature = 1024, kernel = 7, maxPooling = 3, dropout = 0.25)
4. Fully-connected layer (units = 128, dropout = 0.25)
5. Fully-connected layer (units = 128, dropout = 0.25)
6. Output (activation = softmax, units = 12)

All Layers except output use ReLU activation functions.

Model was implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend (python3).

The final model trained 10 epochs using rmsprop and reached an accuracy of 0.7171 on the validation set (0.9/0.1 split).

==> b) expected accuracy on the test set ~0.7/70%
